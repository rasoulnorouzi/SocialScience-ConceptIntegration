# SocialScience-ConceptIntegration


This project benchmarks machine learning models for concept harmonization, merging heterogeneous social science terms (e.g., "Insomnia" and "Sleeping Disorders") into unified constructs. We use a factorial design to test five different vector representation models against three distinct harmonization strategies. The rigorous evaluation framework assesses each model's performance, reliability, and bias, offering a clear guide for integrating concepts in social science research.
